# Demo app using Google Map API (Places API)

## API Keys
Have your own API key, go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)

 1. Create an API Key for your project
 2. Click on library, and click on Places API
 3. Click on **Enable**
 4. Click on credentials, click key


## How this works
This is just a simple app where it uses the autocomplete functionality and uses coordinates (Latitude and Longitude) to plot the entered location on Google Map
